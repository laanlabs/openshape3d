# Modelling in openshape3d

You drive the live app. Every operation you send is recorded as an undoable,
parametric feature — the person watching sees the part appear in their
viewport and can carry on editing it by hand. Work in their terms: when you
report back, give sizes, wall thickness and file names, not ids.

Two equivalent clients; use whichever you have:

| You have | Change the design | Read it |
|---|---|---|
| the `os3d` MCP tool | `os3d {op, args}` — every feature below, plus `command.run` (`args: {"id":"view.fit"}`) and `document.export` | the same tool: `op` `health`, `state`, `faces` / `edges` (`args: {"body": id}`), `sketches`, `check`, `screenshot`, `commands` |
| a shell | `curl -s -X POST $B/v1/exec -d '{"op":…,"args":{…}}'`; commands `POST $B/v1/command -d '{"id":"view.fit"}'`; files `GET "$B/v1/export?format=stl&up=z&body=<id>" -o part.stl` | `GET $B/v1/state`, `/v1/faces?body=`, `/v1/edges?body=`, `/v1/sketches`, `/v1/check`, `/v1/screenshot` |

`B=http://127.0.0.1:8787` unless the app was launched on another port.
Everything goes through the one `os3d` tool on purpose: the person approves
it once and is never asked again. The commands you need are
`view.isometric`, `view.front`, `view.top`, `view.right`, `view.fit`,
`edit.undo`, `edit.redo` (op `commands` / `GET /v1/commands` for all).

Start with health (op `health` / `GET /v1/health`): `hasDocument:false`
means the project gallery is showing — ask the person to open or create a
design. Launching the app is `docs/AI_MODELING_SETUP.md`.

## Conventions that decide whether the part comes out right

- **Millimetres and degrees** in every feature. Only sketch-entity angles
  (arc `startAngle`/`endAngle`, polygon/ellipse `rotation`) are radians.
- **Y is up.** The ground is the XZ plane. A default sketch (`sketch.create`
  with no args) lies on the ground: sketch `(u, v)` is world `(u, 0, −v)`,
  and a positive extrude grows **up** (+Y). A sketch on top of a body sits at
  `origin: [0, h, 0]` with the same axes.
- A **vertical** sketch for side profiles and revolves:
  `{"origin":[0,0,0],"xAxis":[1,0,0],"yAxis":[0,1,0]}` — then `u` is world X
  (the radius) and `v` is world Y (the height).
- **Profiles are found by a seed point**: `seedPoint` is any point strictly
  inside the closed region, in sketch `(u, v)`. **One seed = one region**: a
  sketch with three circles cuts only the seeded one. Several holes are one
  seeded cut each, or one cutter body and `feature.pattern`.
- A revolve's `axisPoint` / `axisDirection` are in the sketch's own `(u, v)`.
  The vertical axis through the origin is `[0,0]`, `[0,1]`. Keep the whole
  profile on one side of the axis (`u ≥ 0`).
- Face and edge **indices are per-shape**: list them again after every
  feature, never reuse an index from before an edit.
- Ids are UUID strings copied from replies (`sketchID`, `producedBodyIDs`,
  `bodies[].id`). Never invent one.
- Booleans want overlap: a tool that stops exactly on a face, or a cut whose
  wall coincides with the target's, is the classic kernel failure. Run cuts
  through and past the target; overlap unions by a millimetre.

## The loop

1. `state` — what is already there (bodies with `volumeMM3` and `bounds`).
2. Build with `exec`, one op per call, and read each reply: `bodies[]` is
   the new state, `producedBodyIDs` / `changedBodyIDs` / `removedBodyIDs`
   say what happened. **`"failed": true`** means the feature was recorded
   but did not build — read `message`, undo once (`command.run`
   `edit.undo`), fix the arguments. Never retry a call unchanged.
3. **Verify with numbers, not pictures**: compare `volumeMM3` and `bounds`
   with what you expect (work the volume out by hand — a wrong boolean or a
   zero-thickness wall is invisible in a screenshot).
4. Look once at the end: `view.isometric`, `view.fit`, wait a second,
   screenshot. Hide the construction sketches first (`item.setHidden` with
   `"allSketches": true`) so the person sees the solids.
5. Before anything is manufactured: `check` (`valid: true`, no findings),
   then export.

## Operations (`op` → `args`)

| op | args |
|---|---|
| `sketch.create` | none = ground plane; or `origin`, `xAxis`, `yAxis` (world vectors), `name`. Reply: `sketchID` |
| `sketch.addEntities` | `sketchID`, `entities[]` (below); optional `construction` (indices) |
| `feature.extrude` | `sketchID`, `seedPoint` `[u,v]`, `distance`; optional `symmetric` (±distance, so 2× tall), `taperDegrees` (positive narrows), `boolean`, `booleanTargets` |
| `feature.revolve` | `sketchID`, `seedPoint`, `axisPoint` `[u,v]`, `axisDirection` `[u,v]`; optional `angleDegrees` (360), `boolean`, `booleanTargets` |
| `feature.loft` | `sections[]` of `{sketchID, seedPoint}` (≥2, each profile on its own plane, in order); optional `boolean`, `booleanTargets` |
| `feature.sweep` | `sketchID`, `seedPoint`, `spine` `[[x,y,z],…]` (world) or `helix` `{axisPoint, axisDirection, radius, pitch, turns}`; the profile sketch sits at the spine's start, normal to it |
| `feature.shell` | `bodyID`, `thickness` (positive hollows inward), `openFaces` `[faceIndex,…]` (omit for a sealed hollow) |
| `feature.fillet` | `bodyID`, `radius`, `edges` `[edgeIndex,…]` |
| `feature.chamfer` | `bodyID`, `setback`, `edges` `[edgeIndex,…]` |
| `feature.boolean` | `kind` (`union` / `subtract` / `intersect`), `targetBodyID`, `toolBodyIDs[]` |
| `feature.pattern` | `bodyID`, `count` (total, including the original); `kind` `circular` (default: about `axis`, default +Y, through `center`, over `totalAngleDegrees` 360) or `linear` (`axis` = direction, `spacing` mm) |
| `feature.mirror` | `bodyID`, `planeOrigin`, `planeNormal`; `keepOriginal` true (default) leaves a mirrored copy, false moves the body |
| `feature.transform` | `bodyID`; `translation` `[x,y,z]` and/or `rotationDegrees` with `rotationAxis` (default +Z — pass `[0,1,0]` to turn about the vertical) and `rotationCenter`, and/or `scale`. Moves in place, same id |
| `feature.pushPull` | `bodyID`, `face`, `distance` (negative pushes in) |
| `feature.moveFace` / `scaleFace` / `rotateFace` | `bodyID`, `face`; `delta` `[du,dv,dn]` in the face's basis / `factor` / `angleDegrees` (+ `axis`) |
| `feature.draftFace` | `bodyID`, `face`, `angleDegrees` (±89); the neutral plane defaults to the ground |
| `feature.deleteFace` | `bodyID`, `faces[]` — the kernel heals over them (removes a fillet or a boss) |
| `feature.replaceFace` | `bodyID`, `face`, `targetOrigin`, `targetNormal` (world plane) |
| `feature.imprint` | `bodyID`, `sketchID` (or `sketchIDs`) — splits the faces the sketch lies on, so a region push/pulls on its own |
| `body.setMaterial` | `bodyIDs[]`, `preset` (any library name: Steel, Aluminum, Brass, Chrome, Gold, Copper, Clear Glass, Oak, Concrete, Glow Warm, … — an unknown name lists them all) or `color` `[r,g,b]` / `[r,g,b,a]` 0…1; optional `metallic`, `roughness`, `emission` (glow) |
| `item.setHidden` | `ids[]` and/or `allSketches: true`; optional `hidden` (true) |
| `item.rename` | `id` (body or sketch) and `name`; exported files show body names |
| `item.select` | `ids[]` — select exactly these bodies; `[]` clears the selection. An import or a feature leaves its result selected (drawn with the blue accent tint), so clear it before a screenshot or a recording to see the model in its own colours and textures |
| `view.visualize` | enter Visualize (no grid or edges, lit by the design's environment) and optionally set `preset` (Studio, Daylight, Sunset, Overcast, Warm Interior, Night), `lightRotation` °, `sunElevation` 0…90°, `lightIntensity` 0…2, `background` (`environment` / `color` / `transparent`), `backgroundColor` `[r,g,b]`, `groundShadow`; `panel: false` keeps the Visualization panel closed so the viewport shows the model alone; `off: true` leaves. Take the screenshot while it is on for a render-style picture |
| `view.accuracyReport` | `reference`, `model` (body ids), optional `tolerance` mm — opens Views ▸ Accuracy Report… in the app on those two bodies and runs the comparison, so the person sees the report on screen; `off: true` closes it. The numbers themselves come from the `accuracy` read op below |
| `view.deviationPreview` | `reference`, `model` (body ids), optional `tolerance` mm (1), `maxMM` (full colour; five tolerances), `panel: false` (no legend); or `off: true`. Colours the reference in the viewport by its distance to the model — blue where the model is missing material, orange where it has too much, grey within tolerance — with the model ghosted behind it, and replies with the per-vertex numbers (`meanMM`, `p95MM`, `maxMM`, `withinTolerance`, `missing`, `excess`, 0…1). Take a `screenshot` while it is on to SEE where a model is wrong, then turn it off |
| `command.run` | `id` — a view, `edit.undo`, `edit.redo` (MCP; over curl it is `POST /v1/command`) |
| `document.export` | `format` (`stl` / `3mf` / `obj` / `step`), `up` (`"z"` for slicers), `body` `[ids]`, `name` (MCP; over curl it is `GET /v1/export`) |
| `health`, `guide`, `state`, `sketches`, `commands` | no args — reads (MCP; over curl `GET /v1/…`) |
| `faces`, `edges` | `body` — the index lists below |
| `check` | optional `body`, `bop: true` (the slow self-intersection pass) |
| `screenshot` | optional `width`, `height` (default 1024; a JPEG sized for a chat) |

**Inline booleans**: `"boolean"` is a STRING — `"newBody"` (default),
`"union"`, `"subtract"`, `"intersect"` — and the bodies it acts on go in
`"booleanTargets": ["<bodyID>"]`. A cut is an extrude with
`"boolean":"subtract"` that passes through its target.

**Sketch entities**

```json
{"kind":"line","a":[0,0],"b":[40,0]}
{"kind":"rect","min":[-20,-10],"max":[20,10]}
{"kind":"circle","center":[0,0],"radius":12}
{"kind":"polygon","center":[0,0],"radius":10,"sides":6}
{"kind":"ellipse","center":[0,0],"radiusX":20,"radiusY":12}
{"kind":"arc","center":[0,0],"radius":10,"startAngle":0,"endAngle":1.5708}
{"kind":"spline","points":[[0,0],[10,8],[20,0]],"closed":false}
```

A profile made of lines must close exactly: the last `b` equals the first
`a`. Polygon `radius` is the circumscribed circle (across-flats is
`2·r·cos(π/n)`).

## Reading faces and edges

`faces[]` rows: `index`, `kind` (`planar`, `cylindrical` with `radius`, or
`other` with `referenceable: false` — a torus-class blend you cannot pick),
`areaMM2`, `centroid`, `normal`, all in world mm. The top of a body is the
planar face with normal `[0,1,0]` and the highest centroid `y`; the floor of
a pot is the planar face with normal `[0,1,0]` *inside* the walls.

`edges[]` rows: `index`, `faces` `[a, b]` (the two face indices it joins),
`midpoint`, `lengthMM`, `convex` (true on an outside corner, false in a
groove). The rim of a cup is every edge whose midpoint `y` is the top
height; a circular edge's length is its circumference. Edges missing from
the list are seams, which never blend. Fillet an edge loop together in one
call, not one edge per call.

## Recipes

**Plate with a hole** — ground sketch → `rect` + `circle` in ONE sketch →
extrude with the seed inside the rectangle but outside the circle: the hole
comes for free. Several holes: one sketch, one seeded `subtract` extrude per
hole through the plate.

**Turned part (pot, vase, knob, wheel)** — vertical sketch, draw HALF the
cross-section of the wall as a closed loop of lines at `u ≥ 0`, revolve about
`[0,0]`,`[0,1]`. Starting the loop at `u = r` instead of `u = 0` leaves a
hole of radius `r` along the axis (a drainage hole). The exact volume is
Pappus: `2π · centroid_u · area` — compare it to `volumeMM3`.

**Hollow box / enclosure** — extrude the outside, `faces` to find the top
(planar, normal `[0,1,0]`, highest centroid), `feature.shell` with that index
in `openFaces`. A lid is a second plate whose lip is `0.3 mm` smaller than
the opening.

**Rounded edges** — `edges`, pick by `midpoint` / `lengthMM` / the adjacent
faces, `feature.fillet` with all of them at once. A radius larger than the
wall or the neighbouring face fails with "too large for the local geometry":
keep it under half the thinnest dimension, and fillet before shelling only
if the wall is thicker than the radius.

**Boss, peg, stand-off** — a circle on a sketch at the face's height
(`origin: [0, h, 0]`), extrude with `"boolean":"union"` and the body as the
target; start the sketch `0.5 mm` inside the body so the union overlaps.

**Several parts** — every new-body feature returns its id. Move one beside
another with `feature.transform`; export them one file each with `body`.

**Over a 3D scan (scan → CAD)** — `document.import` the scan (it lands
selected: `item.select` `[]` before any picture), and build ON its axis and
base so `accuracy` compares in place. Measure before modelling: a part of
revolution is its radius-by-height profile plus the lumps that stand proud
of it (nozzles, lugs, pegs). Find the axis by roundness, not by extent:
try each principal direction and keep the one whose thin slices are the
roundest (a bucket's handle pulls the long direction over, a wheel's axis
is its thinnest direction). Check the scale first (glTF is metres, but
scans arrive at any size) and which end is the base (the wider end,
unless a hose or a head makes the top wider). The body ends where the
rings do: where a slice's points leave a third of the circle empty, that
is a handle, a lever or a hose, not a cross-section — stop the revolve
under it and leave it out (a handle is not a turned shape); the deviation
preview will show it in blue, which is right. Read the body radius at each height from the
sectors that AGREE — the densest cluster of per-sector radii — never from
the median or a percentile across all sectors: a nozzle, its flared root,
the chain from its cap and a scanner hole all pull those, and a profile
traced from them grows rings the part does not have. Draw design intent,
not the trace: a cylinder is ONE vertical line (a run of heights whose
radii agree within the scan's noise, 2–3 mm, with no drift from one end to
the other, is one segment at their median), a flange is a level step, a
cone a straight segment, and a dome, a barrel's belly or a can's shoulder
an ARC (`arc` entity) — a circle through the simplified polyline's run of
same-way turns that every traced band between its ends sits within the
noise of (collapsing such a run into a cylinder and two cones cuts the
belly into terraces, which is exactly what the deviation preview painted on
the beer mug); nothing smaller than the noise. A boss is roughly a cylinder —
its root about as wide as its neck; a thin spike on a wide base is a chain
link or a flange's edge, not a boss. A container is a shell, not a drum:
cast rays down the axis from outside each end — on a closed end they hit
the skin at once, into a bucket they fall to the floor's inside (a FRONT
face, deep in) or out through a floor the scanner never saw; rays that
cross a scan's trimmed-off ground and hit the inside of the part's own top
(a BACK face) mean a solid with a hole, not an open end. Then revolve a
HOLLOW half-section — the outer profile up, the rim across at the open
end, the inner profile a wall thickness in (lines moved in, a dome or a
belly a concentric arc), and a floor one wall thick at the closed end —
at the wall the inner surface shows, 3 mm when it shows none. (The
kernel's `feature.shell` is the offset way and works on a plain bucket,
but it refused a ribbed barrel at every thickness; the hollow sketch
never fails.) One revolve for the body, one union-revolve per boss,
nothing else. A part that is NOT turned (a
clamp frame, a bracket) is an extrude: cut a section (`trimesh.section`)
where it is thickest, trace the loop into lines and arcs (a tessellated
arc is a run of equal chords turning one way with the tangent points as
vertices; a rounded corner is one `arc`), extrude the thickness, and add
what the section missed as its own feature — a round boss on an arm is an
r-cylinder about the bore's axis unioned in, then the bore cut; the
C-clamp practice part came out at 0.05 mm mean this way. Then `accuracy`
and `accuracy.image` on every view: when the model's outline shows steps,
rings or a lump the scan's silhouette does not, the profile is wrong —
undo, re-sketch it cleaner (fewer points at the agreed radii), and compare
again. More points never fix a ridged profile; the right radius does.
`view.deviationPreview` then shows the person where the model still
misses the scan, on the scan. The app's overlap number alone is not a
verdict: a bucket modelled as a solid drum overlapped 93 % from the front.
Export both meshes and run `scripts/scan_to_cad/inspect_fit.py` — distance
both ways (the model-to-scan direction finds the lid), depth maps per view
with the worst strip, and `review.png` to LOOK at — before calling a model
done; a FAIL is not filmed.

## Checking a model against a scan or a reference part

`accuracy` with `{"reference": "<id>", "model": "<id>"}` measures how
closely the model body matches the reference body — a part built over an
imported 3D scan against the scan, a rebuild against the original. The reply
carries, per standard view (`front`, `top`, `right` by default), the
silhouette overlap (`iou`, 0…1), the two areas, the missing and excess
areas, and how far the outlines sit apart (`boundaryMeanMM`, `boundaryP95MM`,
`boundaryMaxMM`); then the surface deviation both ways (`referenceToModel`,
`modelToReference`: `meanMM`, `rmsMM`, `p95MM`, `maxMM`, `withinTolerance`,
`meanSignedMM` — positive means the model is undersized there), the size
difference per axis (`extentDeltaMM`), the volumes when both meshes are
closed, and a `summary` paragraph to repeat to the person. Options:
`views` (a list, any of the six), `tolerance` (mm, default 1), `align`
(`none` compares where the bodies sit — build the model on the scan's own
axis and base; `boundsCenter` or `base` first moves the model onto the
reference), `resolution` (pixels across the overlay, default 512).
`accuracy.image` with `"view": "front"` returns the overlay as a picture:
the reference silhouette filled, the model's outline over it.
`view.deviationPreview` puts the same measurement on the part in the
viewport — blue where the model is missing material, orange where it has
too much — for the person, and for you through `screenshot`: a ring the
scan does not have, a nozzle set too low, a lug that should not be there
all show as colour where they are. Aim for an overlap above 95 % and a
95th-percentile deviation under the tolerance; compare after every change
that matters, not only at the end, and report the numbers in millimetres
and percent.

## Exporting for 3D printing

MCP: `document.export` with `format: "stl"` (or `"3mf"`), **`up: "z"`**,
`body: ["<id>"]` when only one part should be in the file, and a `name`;
the file lands in the person's Downloads folder and the reply gives
`fileName`, `path`, `sizeMM` (width × depth × height as written — check it
against what was asked) and `triangles`. Over curl:
`GET "/v1/export?format=stl&up=z&body=<id>" -o part.stl`. Slicers are Z-up,
the app is Y-up, and `up:"z"` stands the part on the bed exactly as it
stands on the ground plane here. Units are millimetres. `format: "step"`
hands the exact B-rep to another CAD tool; STL carries no colour.

Design for the printer while modelling, not after: walls ≥ 1.2 mm (three
0.4 mm perimeters; 2–3 mm for anything that holds soil or water), overhangs
≤ 45° from vertical print without supports, a flat face on the ground plane
is the bed face, and clearances between mating parts ≥ 0.3 mm.

## When something goes wrong

Errors are named, and the name is the fix: `unknown_op`,
`unknown_entity_kind`, `bad_boolean_type` (you sent an object, send a
string), `missing_boolean_targets`, `unknown_sketch` / `unknown_body` (stale
or invented id — re-read state), `unknown_edge` / `unknown_face` (re-list),
`one_face_only`, `no_document` (ask the person to open a design). A kernel
message ("fillet: this size is too large…", a boolean that returns the
target unchanged) means the geometry, not the syntax: smaller radius, more
overlap, or a different order of operations. Each exec is one undo step;
undo a failed feature before trying again so History stays clean.
Full protocol: `docs/AGENT_CONTROL.md`.
